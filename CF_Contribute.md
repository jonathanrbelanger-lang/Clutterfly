# 🦋 Contributing to Clutterfly


First off, thank you for even considering contributing.  
Clutterfly exists to reduce anxiety, not create it—so our contribution guidelines are simple and humane.

## 🌱 Philosophy


- **Safety first**: Originals are sacred. No contribution should ever risk user data.  
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Code should be easy to read, easy to trust.  
- **Humane narration**: Every step should explain itself in plain language.  
- **Simplicity**: One script, one job. Avoid unnecessary dependencies.  
- **Enrichment, not extraction**: Contributions should empower users, not overwhelm them.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute


- **Try it out**: Run Clutterfly and share your experience.  
- **Report issues**: If something feels confusing, unsafe, or unclear, open an Issue.  
- **Suggest improvements**: Keep them aligned with the philosophy above.  
- **Pull requests**: Welcome! Please explain *why* your change matters in plain language.

## ⚖️ A Note on Scope


Clutterfly is intentionally small. It’s not meant to be a full photo manager or a feature‑packed app.  
If your idea makes the script more complex than it needs to be, consider proposing it as an optional “blade” or companion script instead.
