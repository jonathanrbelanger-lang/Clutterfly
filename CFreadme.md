🌱 Why This Exists


Most people don’t set out to create chaos in their digital lives—it just happens. Every new phone, every camera card, every “backup” folder copied onto the next computer adds another layer to the warren. Before long, you’re staring at gigabytes of photos scattered across a maze of folders, unsure what’s safe to delete, and too anxious to touch anything.  


That anxiety is real. For many, their photos are their memories, and the fear of losing them is paralyzing. At the same time, the clutter slows down computers, makes them harder to use, and leaves people more vulnerable to mistakes.  


Clutterfly exists to change that.  


It is:  
- Humane: Explains what it’s doing, in plain language, every step of the way.  
- Safe: Never deletes without permission, and always reassures.  
- Empowering: Gives people clarity and control over their own digital lives.  
- Free: Because peace of mind shouldn’t come with a price tag.

🛡️ Safety First


- No deletions: Your original files are never touched.  
- Copies only: If you choose to organize, Clutterfly makes a new folder called Organized_Photos.  
- Transparency: Every step is narrated in plain language.  
- System checks: Clutterfly verifies disk space and CPU load before copying, so it won’t crash your machine or fill your drive.

🧭 How to Find Your Folder Path


When Clutterfly asks for a folder path, here’s how to find it:


- Windows  
  1. Open File Explorer.  
  2. Navigate to the folder (e.g., “Pictures”).  
  3. Click once in the address bar at the top.  
  4. It will change into text like:  
     `
     C:\Users\Mary\Pictures
     `  
  5. Copy that text and paste it into Clutterfly.


- Mac  
  1. Open Finder.  
  2. Right‑click the folder and choose Get Info.  
  3. Look for “Where:” in the Info window—that’s the path.  
  4. Or, drag the folder into a Terminal window, and the path will appear automatically.


- Linux  
  1. Open your file manager.  
  2. Right‑click the folder and choose Properties or Information.  
  3. Copy the “Parent Folder” or “Path” shown.  
  4. Or, drag the folder into a Terminal window.

🧪 Beta Note


Clutterfly is intentionally simple and marked as beta.  
Its purpose is not to be perfect, but to be approachable.  


- If you’re new to scripting, you should be able to read this code, understand it, and even adapt it.  
- If you’re experienced, you’re welcome to improve it—but the real goal is to show that even a small script can make a big difference.  


This project is a reminder: do good because you can.
