# 🎶 Background & Soundtrack


Clutterfly wasn’t built in silence. It came together in the margins of long nights and early mornings, carried forward by a soundtrack that kept the work moving.  
This playlist isn’t part of the program itself — it’s the *background energy* that shaped its design.  
It reflects the same principles that guide Clutterfly: clarity, defiance, care, and a refusal to hide the voices that deserve to be front and center.

## ✨ Why It Matters
This soundtrack is a cultural artifact — a reminder that tools are never just code.  
They’re shaped by the energy, defiance, and focus of the people who build them.  
Clutterfly carries that lineage: humane, user‑centered, and unapologetically alive.
