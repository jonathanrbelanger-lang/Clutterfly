Hey there—welcome to Clutterfly’s issue board.  
This isn’t a bug tracker so much as a campfire. Grab a seat, tell your story, and let’s see what we can do together.

## 🌱 What’s going on?
Describe what you ran into. Don’t worry about the “right” words—just tell it like it happened.

## 🦋 What did you expect?
What were you hoping Clutterfly would do? Paint the picture so we can see it through your eyes.

## 🛠️ What actually happened?
Did it throw an error, stall out, or just feel confusing? Share the details you noticed.
